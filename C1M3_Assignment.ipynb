    "In this assignment, you'll start by working with a basic `Graph` class that comes with simple methods. Then, you'll move on to another class named `Graph_Advanced`. Here, you'll be tasked with implementing four methods to tackle four different problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the Graph class cannot be modified in any way. However, you're free to add as many methods as you need to the `Graph_Advanced` class to address the challenges you'll encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect you to leverage an LLM (Large Language Model) to aid in developing the algorithms. These algorithms should not only aim for solutions that are close to optimal but also adhere to a specific time execution limit. We provide an LLM with GPT-3.5 for you, the link is [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-generative-ai-for-software-development/ungradedLab/Vuqvf/gpt-3-5-environment), but feel free to use the LLM you want!\n",

    "We expect you to use LLMs in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Begin by clearly defining the problem you are trying to solve or the concept you wish to understand better. Present this to the LLM in a concise manner.\n",
    "- Engage with the LLM as if it were a knowledgeable peer. Ask questions, seek clarifications, and propose hypotheses for the LLM to comment on.\n",
    "- Provide the LLM the Graph class given to you and ask it to explain how it works.\n",
    "- After receiving input from the LLM, critically evaluate the information and decide how best to apply it to your work. Not all suggestions from the LLM may be directly applicable or correct; part of your task is to discern the most valuable advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NOTE**: DO **NOT** use joblib or any parallel computing technique as it will break the autograder. If necessary explicitily tell the LLM to avoid such algorithms. You also should **NOT** install new libraries. If you want to use a library not imported here (with exception of joblib and multiprocessing or any other for parallel computing), please do so in the Graph_Advanced cell.\n",

However, passing all the unittests doesn't guarantee success in this assignment, as the autograder will subject your solutions to more extensive testing. To successfully pass this assignment, your solution needs to meet the requirements in more than 85% of the test cases. If your solution fails, you will receive up to three examples highlighting where your algorithm fell short, along with instructions on how to replicate the graphs for debugging purposes."

Share your logic and seek optimization tips to refine your solutions. You can even ask the LLM to build the code for you, with any specification you want.\n",

    "4. **Developing Helper Methods**: Before adding helper methods to the `Graph_Advanced` class, discuss your ideas with the LLM for feedback on implementation strategies, ensuring they align with the class's integrity.\n",

    "5. **Testing Solutions with LLM**: Use the LLM to strategize and review your testing approach, especially for tests that yield unexpected results. It can offer debugging and optimization advice to improve your solutions.\n",

If you see the message \"All tests passed!\" for every unittest, your assignment is likely ready for submission. If not, you'll be able to see which cases your code didn't pass and understand why. **Remember, the unittests here cover only a few example cases due to the constraints of this environment. The grading process will include more extensive testing. It's possible to pass all the tests here but still fail some during the autograding.** However, if that happens, don't worry—you will receive feedback on why you failed, which will allow you to adjust your functions and resubmit the assignment. You're welcome to submit your assignment multiple times as needed.\n",
